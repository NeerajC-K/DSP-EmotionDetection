in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers - á
no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be á

anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  á
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not á
pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others á
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two á
hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and á

projects more than this one."

brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door á
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were á
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many á
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of á
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The á
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."

friends."

bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried á
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two á

have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and á
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would á
understand this as they had always done).  They did not á
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many á
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was á
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while á

It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a á
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with á
them."

plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat á
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."

shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on á
his face and I thought that he would choose me."

he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's á
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so á
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á
I was in a bad mood then)."

several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend á

the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major á
subject if I were to change it."

person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á
say anything but just watched me leave."

had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á

C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had á

 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was á
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very á
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost á
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
sad,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a á
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I á
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
anger,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á
child to teach."
sad,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á
would think that I had not prepared for it."
